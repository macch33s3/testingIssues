Click "Start commit":

Commit

Add a commit message if you like and click "Commit changes". If the code above is working (feel free to copy and paste mine to compare) there shouldn't be any errors when you committed the code. Read more about the types of syntax required for GitHub Issue Forms over on the GitHub Docs. If you have an error ðŸ”´, skip step 4, and jump down to the "HELP ðŸ”´" step.

Step 4. Fill out your form
Your form should now be complete! Now to test it:

Go to the repository where you made the template
Click the "Issues" tab
Click "New Issue"
Select the issue template you just created.
Mine is called "Tip Request" since this was the I have under name: in my template file.

Click "Get Started" and your issue form should be displayed.

This is what mine looks like:

GitHub Issue Form

You can see all the elements in the form that were added into the file. You can see the red asterisk * next to required fields.

Check out this form and match it up to the code aboveabove.

Step HELP ðŸ”´ Get GitHub to help you build the form
One thing I love about GitHub Issue Forms is that if you get stuck building your template, GitHub is pretty good at helping you. For example, if you commit your code and you forgot to add a certain element, GitHub will give you an error, such as this:

Body error

This error means that the forth element in my form (body[4]) is missing one of its options. If we go back and compare the code, I can see that the forth element is the checkboxes at the end of the form and they don't have any options:

Code body4

All I need to do is add the options like this:

Error fix

If all this sounds really scary, or you're not sure where to start, or how to fix errors, GitHub can help. When you're creating your template, on the right hand side, you'll see some options to help you:

options

This handy configuration helper provides information on what needs to be included in the yaml file. There are code snippets to copy and paste and lots of information. It makes building these issue forms much easier and has helpful explanations about all the fields.

GitHub Issue Forms are still in beta
As of right now (August 2021), GitHub Issue forms are still in beta.

If you're reading this and issue templates are still in beta, then you might notice a Beta tag when you were creating the yaml file. Feedback is always super welcome and I promise the GitHub team reads every single piece of feedback and all suggestions.

If you'd like to give feedback on GitHub Issue forms, or any other feature, visit our Discussions Feedback.
