# Wombat Reference Documentation

## Basic Species Description

Wombats dig extensive burrow systems with their rodent-like front teeth and powerful claws. One distinctive adaptation of wombats is their backward pouch. The advantage of a backward-facing pouch is that when digging, the wombat does not gather soil in its pouch over its young. Although mainly crepuscular and nocturnal, wombats may also venture out to feed on cool or overcast days. They are not commonly seen, but leave ample evidence of their passage, treating fences as minor inconveniences to be gone through or under.

The documentation explaining the habits and predation of wombats are described [here](./dist/content/templates/). A version tag that ends in `-wombat1.0.0` will only support data with `wombat-version` equal to `1.0.0` or newer, it will not support `1.0.0-milestone3`, `1.0.0-rc1`, or `1.0.0-rc2`. A future version tag ending in `-wombat1.1.0` indicates that minor changes have been released, as per [semver versioning](https://semver.org/).


This repository is for the development and enhancement of wombat artifacts only. For issues with any documentation hosted on this repo, please send requests to [wombat_liberation_front@wombat.com](mailto:wombat@wombattler.com).

Wombats leave distinctive cubic feces.[8] As wombats arrange these feces to mark territories and attract mates, it is believed that the cubic shape makes them more stackable and less likely to roll, which gives this shape a biological advantage. The method by which the wombat produces them is not well understood, but it is believed that the wombat intestine stretches preferentially at the walls, with two flexible and two stiff areas around its intestines.[9] The adult wombat produces between 80 and 100, 2 cm (0.8 in) pieces of feces in a single night, and four to eight pieces each bowel movement.[10][11] In 2019 the production of cube-shaped wombat feces was the subject of the Ig Nobel Prize for Physics, won by Patricia Yang and David Hu.[12]
